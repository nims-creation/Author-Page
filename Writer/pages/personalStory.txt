My journey began in a small town near Varanasi, Kapsethi—a place that’s as unassuming as it is close to my heart.
I spent my early years at CPS, the school where I grew up not just in age but in outlook. I wasn’t the star of every class,
but I held my own. Physics, though, was a different story. There was something about it—maybe it was the logic,
the problem-solving, or just the way it explained the world around me. It clicked with me in ways no other subject did, 
and I loved every moment I spent with it.
When I finished school, I had my sights set higher. Through relentless studying and a touch of luck, 
I earned admission to Tezpur University, a government college, to pursue B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
It felt like a whole new world was opening up—a chance to explore something far beyond the dusty lanes of Kapsethi.

The University Experience
The first few months at university were intense. New faces, challenging coursework, and the weight of expectation. 
I threw myself into my studies initially, wanting to make the most of the opportunity. But as time went by, 
I realized there was more to college than just labs and lectures. Friendships, laughter, the occasional midnight 
chai—all these became as important to me as academics. I learned to loosen up, enjoy the moments, and just be present.
But it was during my third year that my life took an unexpected turn.

A Spark of Something Special
I’ll never forget the day I reconnected with someone from my past. She was my junior back in CPS, and we’d barely 
known each other back then. But thanks to social media, we started talking. What began as casual chats about our 
shared school memories soon turned into something deeper. We started sharing dreams, ideas, and even the little 
quirks about our day-to-day lives.
It wasn’t long before I realized I’d fallen for her. She wasn’t just someone I talked to—she was someone I cared 
deeply about. Over the next seven or eight months, she became an integral part of my life. I’d never imagined 
myself feeling this way about anyone, but it happened, and it felt right.

When Things Fell Apart
And then, out of nowhere, it ended.
Without explanation, she stepped away. No reasons were given, no closure was offered. At first, I was in denial. 
I searched for answers, replaying our conversations and trying to pinpoint where things went wrong. But life doesn’t 
always provide neat conclusions.
It was a difficult phase. On the outside, I kept up appearances—classes, friends, and all the usual college chaos. 
But inside, I was grappling with questions I couldn’t answer. It felt like a piece of me had been taken away, and 
I wasn’t sure how to fill the void.

Moving Forward
Time, as they say, is a healer. Slowly but surely, I started focusing on myself again. I returned to the things 
I loved—my studies, spending time with friends, and dreaming about the future. That heartbreak, though painful, 
taught me a lot. It showed me the strength I never knew I had and reminded me that life is as much about loss 
as it is about gain.
Looking back, I wouldn’t erase that chapter. It was real, raw, and meaningful in its own way. It’s a part of who 
I am now, and for that, I’m grateful.
