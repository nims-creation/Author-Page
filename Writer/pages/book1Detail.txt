If Chud Gaye Guru had a Face: what if chud gaye....

This book captures the chaotic, funny reality of Gen Z life, where "chud gaye" (a slang term for feeling burnt out) becomes a relatable theme.
Rather than offering polished advice, it dives into the absurd pressures on young adults todayâ€”from social media's endless "personal branding" 
game to hustle culture's demand to monetize everything we love. This sitcom is ironic in that everything comes together online, and individuals 
can't even get something straight in real life. A lot of the episodes contain relationships, wellness, and identity comedy, exploring how Gen Z 
navigates around the ambiguity of things such as dating, the emergence of wellness fads, and the freedom of constantly self-evolving identity.

The book hails this paradox of the technology age, being simultaneously a tool and a trap, at the same time that the young adult feels highly 
connected but isolated. What it communicates is simple: we're all a bit lost, and that's okay. Rather than wanting to perfect things, they 
find solace in this sense of solidarity and taking life in its messiness. And finally, it is just not burnout; rather, chud gaye is a mood, 
a mindset, which brings people to laughter and resilience in an overwhelming world.
